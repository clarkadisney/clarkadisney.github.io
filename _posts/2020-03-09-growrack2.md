## Initial Self Runs
 
<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/assets/images/growrack/rackv2_2.JPG">
<img class="projectimage" src="/assets/images/growrack/rackv2_2.JPG"></a>
 
Planted greens in 3601 inserts inside 1020 trays...initially microgreens then shifted to allowing baby greens to grow and practicing "cut and come back."

Greens were slow to grow at first but once cut would return in 4-7 days. Plant needed to be pulled around 4-5th cut, and was usually too "leggy" by 2nd. Watering 30m before cutting avoided bitter flavor.
 
## Second Shelf
 
<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/assets/images/growrack/rackv2_6.JPG"><img class="projectimage" src="/assets/images/growrack/rackv2_6.JPG"></a>
 
Added second shelf of 3601's, replacing the 17w fixture with a second 30w 0shop light. At roughly 12" got great growth from bok choy, microgreens, and baby greens. Planted beets to see what happens.

## Initial Tent runs
 
<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/assets/images/growrack/rackv2_4.JPG"><img class="projectimage" src="/assets/images/growrack/rackv2_4.JPG"></a>
 
Began by "jump starting" some pothos and other houseplants that were propogating in water and "rejuvenating" some almost-dead overwintered plants from 2019
 
 
## Herbs
Added packed 3601 herb tray and had great results. Presence of ladybug begins...both a good sign (aphid patrol) and a bad sign (aphids)
