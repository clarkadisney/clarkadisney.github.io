# What is a mycorrhiza? 
 
A common soil-based, plant-fungus relationship that helps plants feed and develop resilience against drought, infection, and disease. It is potentially a good <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173270/plants-ability-slow-climate-change-depends">carbon sink</a>, although that appears to have been commercially displaced by <a href="https://www.willistonherald.com/news/business/the-story-of-a-business-evolution-or-2/article_e32066de-c17d-5c93-b759-d74e352f3210.html">Leonardite</a>. Myco does best in no-till, undisturbed soil and is generally depleted/not present in areas where industrialized farming is prominent. It can be bought dried and powdered and added to soil to promote growth, restoration - and is sometimes hombrewed in <a href="https://moldresistantstrains.com/diy-how-to-make-mycorrhizal-fungi-inoculant/">commercial quantities</a>. There are many types, and certain strains are best suited for certain plants.
 
### More specifically?
It's a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a plant. Two types of mycorrhizal fungi are commonly used as soil amendments - endomycorrhiza (AKA "endo" or arbuscular) and ectomycorrhiza (AKA ecto). Both (more or less) take carbon and sugar in exchange for funneling minerals and water to the plant (not always, and there are other types - not relevant here). It is natually occuring but is usually <a href="https://north40ag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mycorrhizal-Fungi-and-Field-Crops.pdf">depleted</a> in heavily-tilled areas.
 
### Endo (inside)
Endo forms a penetrative bond with plant roots and takes in carbon / sugar from the plant in exchange for funneling the plant water and minerals in the soil and its surroundings - especially phosphorus. Endo species come from one Phylum, and is found in nearly 85% of plant species.

### Ecto (outside)
The latter (ecto) is found in ~2% of plant species - typically  the roots of trees and more "woody" plants. Unlike endo, ecto does not penetrate the plant's cell walls. The exchange is more or less the same, however the dense intercellular interface between the fungi and plant roots can also help it to survive adverse events (drought, wind, etc). Notable, Ecto may be a much better carbon sink than endo:

        <p> Ectomycorrhizal fungi are better able to take up nitrogen in the soil, and plants that associate with this type (known as ECM plants) can take advantage of higher carbon dioxide levels even when nitrogen is low, whereas plants associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (known as AM plants) cannot. </p>

### Plant-specific
Here is a <a href="https://thenutrientcompany.com/blogs/horticulture/the-most-comprehensive-mycorrhizal-plants-list">comprehensive</a> list of the mycorrhizal fungi associated to specific plants.
The "more or less" list of what <i>doesn't</i> appear to benefit from purely mycorrhizal fungi is easier to digest:
 
<figure>
    <blockquote cite="https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/mycorrhizal-fungi.html">
        <p> In total, mycorrhizal fungi benefit 80 to 90 percent of all plant species. Plants that do not respond to mycorrhizae include azalea, beet, blueberry, broccoli, [B]russels sprouts, cabbage/kale, carnation, cauliflower, collards, cranberry, heath, huckleberry, mustard, protea, rhododendron, sedge and spinach.</p>

### Application Specific
In a <a href="https://clarkadisney.github.io/plants/2021/02/02/mycotest1.html">pepper</a> test, I mentioned that I wanted to use great white because of it contained Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma koningii which might help keep my dehydrated food waste soil amendment in check. Such combinations are not uncommon - and mycorrhizal fungi <a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article/77/3/558/517239">play especially well</a> with Trichoderma and many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza_helper_bacteria#:~:text=Mycorrhiza%20helper%20bacteria%20(MHB)%20are,both%20ectomycorrhiza%20and%20arbuscular%20mycorrhiza.&text=MHBs%20enhance%20mycorrhizal%20function%2C%20growth,and%20help%20promote%20defense%20mechanisms.">species of bacteria. 
 
 
## Who really uses it

### Plants!
<a href="https://tobykiers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Noe%CC%88-Kiers-2018-Mycorrhizal-markets-TREE.pdf">Kidding</a>, but <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/the-worlds-biggest-market-and-its-underground">seriously</a>.

### Organic, No-Till, Small Farms, Hobbyist Growers, Forestry
Mycorrhizae is commonly found in living or hot <a href="https://www.pthorticulture.com/en/training-center/urban-horticulturists-see-the-benefits-of-mycorrhizal-fungi/">soils</a> marketed to growers interested in organics or no-till. Some "far-hobbyist" growers make large quantites of it for their own use, as referenced <a href="https://moldresistantstrains.com/diy-how-to-make-mycorrhizal-fungi-inoculant/">above</a>.
 
### Scaled, Industrialized, and Restorative
Africa, restorative, exlporatory - industrialized use in the US is minimal but seen as rising for reasons mentioned below.
 
## Who sells it and why

### Valent Biosciences
Formed by Sumitomo after acquiring Abbott's ag division, Valent Biosciences acquired Mycorrhizal Applications LLC with the intention of building out a "biorational window" for sustainably grown crops.  Valent Sustainable Solutions measures their offerings as "sustainable" and marks whether they're OMRI or CDFA organic input as well.
 
### Farmers Business Network
In 2016 Farmers Business Network Launched a sales channel "FBN Direct" for direct ordering of inputs. There are several listings for mycorrhizae products from vendors like Valent and Helena, however none appear to be currently available.
 
More <a href="https://www.no-tillfarmer.com/articles/10460-fbn-direct-launches-broad-portfolio-of-biological-solutions">recently</a>, FBN announced the launch of Biological solutions on that platform. The soil probiotics appear to be single-strain / bacterial at a significantly higher concentration (CFU/g) than are present in hobbyist offerings. Aside from a lack of myco - the carbon biologicals appear to be <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Ox%20lig%20Technical%20Evaluation%20Report%20%282012%29.pdf">"leonardite"</a> based, which is a topic I'll cover when looking into Biochar. Notable, all of the Biologicals listed are made by a single company, <a href="https://genericcropscience.com/products/other/">Generic Crop Sciences</a>. 

### Scaled for Carbon Offset
It is possible that entrants into this market will have ties to the oil and gas industry. This was true when Sumitomo (via Valent) <a href="https://www.growingproduce.com/vegetables/valent-biosciences-acquires-mycorrhizal-applications-inc/">acquired</a> Mycorrhizal Applications in 2015, and it was still true when Mckinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/a-blueprint-for-scaling-voluntary-carbon-markets-to-meet-the-climate-challenge">published</a> their "A blueprint for scaling voluntary carbon markets..." report in 2021. The connection between those two items is present (though vague) in the first page:

<figure>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/a-blueprint-for-scaling-voluntary-carbon-markets-to-meet-the-climate-challenge">
        <p> Voluntary carbon credits direct private financing to climate-action projects that would not otherwise get off the ground. These projects can have additional benefits such as biodiversity protection, pollution prevention, public-health improvements, and job creation. Carbon credits also support investment into the innovation required to lower the cost of emerging climate technologies.</p>

        <p>For some companies, however, it’s prohibitively expensive to reduce emissions using today’s technologies, though the costs of those technologies might go down in time. And at some businesses, certain sources of emissions cannot be eliminated.</p>

The implication is that certain industries need to offset, and those offsets need to be generated. Farmers can conceivably <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-28/iowa-farmer-finds-fortune-in-selling-carbon-credits-to-shopify">generate them </a>through sustainable farming, then sell them to buyers who wish to offset their carbon pollution. Despite the closing of the Chicago Carbon Exchange (CCX), there are still many private and <a href="https://www.c2es.org/document/us-state-carbon-pricing-policies/">state-level</a> exchanges - with a large <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/china-urges-market-forces-to-fill-gap-in-green-bond-program">Chinese exchange</a> coming online this decade. At this point - commitment to the environment aside, this approach can be seen as strategic positioning for both the users of biological amendments and the brokers of them, who are likely plugged into ecosystems needing carbon offset. A great example of this would be the <a href="https://www.willistonherald.com/news/business/the-story-of-a-business-evolution-or/article_e32066de-c17d-5c93-b759-d74e352f3210.html">history of Leonardite</a>, which is a mineral resource that seems to be the carbon sink amendment du jour.
 
## Summary

### Market Growth

The market will continue to grow for a variety of reasons including end-consumer demand, greater awareness of and desire to remediate soil health, wider and more targeted availability, increased research supporting adoption at scale, and potentially the need to finance via carbon tax credit generation.

### Further Questions

Why did FBN seemingly drop myco for bacteria?

Is bacillus better able to withstand tilling / use in traditional industrialized ag? 

Is Leonardite a preferred carbon sink / circular economy product compared to Myco + trees?

Stay tuned!
