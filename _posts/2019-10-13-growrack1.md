<i>(This was short-lived due to the vent below; we installed a plastic deflector...but then it was too cold!</i> 

## Lechuza SIP planter + Mylar

Our mylar was courtesy an old delivery, and was held in place by large ferns on top.

## GE 17W LED 1600 Lumen Bulb

The Experiment lasted until December then tapered due to lack of light and cold :(
