# Growrack v4
Adding aeration to the bottom of the pots.

## Power Stats:
- Cheap 30x18x36 mylar/canvas tent on bottom 
- 135w QB288 @3500k
- Passive intake baffle made from PC cases
- Active exhaust via PC fans totaling 800mHa wired to 12v wall-wart
- Oscillating 6" 2600mHa fan to disperse

## Egg-crate
Purchased 1/4" Egg-Crate PolySty from <a href="https://plaskolite.com/">Plaskolite</a> to augment 1020 tray channels (keep pots from sitting water). Will leave standing water below pot-line creating air-gap and avoiding anerobic issues )similar to an Orchid humidity tray).
