# Growrack v5
Wrapped the same 260g polyester around a double-stacked 1/4" egg crate to create a wicking surface akin to capillary matting.
 
## Power Stats:
- Cheap 30x18x36 mylar/canvas tent on bottom 
- 135w QB288 @3500k
- Passive intake baffle made from PC cases
- Active exhaust via PC fans totaling 800mHa wired to 12v wall-wart
- Oscillating 6" 2600mHa fan to disperse
- 2x 30w 4000k LED shop lights
- Added 1x 17w 5000k Top bulb

## Explosive growth
 
By far the fastest growth so far; must pay attention to keeping the water line below the fabric surface by roughly 1/4" (or one sheet of egg-crate plastic). Need to add a meter or runoff lines.

## Top Shelf
 
Re-added old 17w fixture to ceiling and used 5000k SunCo Flood with lens removed and diffuser insert. Great growth and "finishing" of greens without the intensity of the tent lighting.
