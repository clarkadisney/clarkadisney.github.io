# Growrack root vegetable intial experiments

## Beets in 3601 plastic

Came out predictably stunted - will redo in square bags or fabric tray liners.

## Carrots in 1/4 Gallon Round bags

Stunted and got fat due to 1/4" layer of perlite on bottom (initially planted for wicking - not needed). Flavorful and otherwise great, will redo densely in an array in sqare bags or fabric tray liners

## Brussel sprouts in SWICK

Stunted initially in 3601 plastic - switched to 1/4" fabric and appears to be doing better
