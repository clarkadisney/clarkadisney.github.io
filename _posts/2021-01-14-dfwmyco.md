# Foodcycler

A "Foodcycler" is a Vitamix/Breville product that poses itself as an electric composter. In reality it dehydrates and pulverizes food quickly, but this cannot be immediately used as compost because it is both dead, and upon becoming moist would likely "rot." 

The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether the foodcycler's Dehydrated Food Waste (DFW) can be used immediately and in greater amount with the addition of commercially-available microbial amendments.

## Tablets
Vitamix mentions that they sell tablets to liquify (like alka-seltzer) and spray on the finished product to aid in soil decomposition. This ends up being (expensive) Trichoderma, Bacillus, and some other ingredients similar to those who have encountered Mycorrhizal Fungi and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza_helper_bacteria">helper bacteria</a>. There are unfortunately, no specifics given RE the above.

## Cost

Running the Foodcycler cost's roughly $0.60 at Chicago's average kWh price of ~$0.13.

## First Run

We did not read the instructions carefully RE "stringy" vegetables - still seemed to process fine.
