# Foodcycler
 
A "Foodcycler" is a Vitamix/Breville product that poses itself as an electric composter. In reality it dehydrates and pulverizes food quickly, but this cannot be immediately used as compost because it is both dead, and upon becoming moist would likely "rot." In their materials they recommend a "rest" period of ~1month, additional microbial amendments, and a soil application ratio of 3/10. For this to make any real sense work we'll need to bump that much higher (discussed below).
 
## Goal
 
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether the foodcycler's Dehydrated Food Waste (DFW) can be used immediately and in greater amount with the addition of commercially-available microbial amendments - and ultimately serve as a tool to process our food waste back into an input.

## Microbial Tablets
Vitamix sells "foodilizer" tablets to be dissolved and sprayed on the finished product to aid in soil decomposition. They mention Trichoderma, Bacillus, and some other ingredients similar to those who have encountered Mycorrhizal Fungi and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza_helper_bacteria">helper bacteria</a>. There is unfortunately, nothing further available as to which strains are included...something we'll likely want control over.

### Overpriced vs market
 
...at roughly 0.3oz for $20 vs ~$5/oz for proven suppliers with targeted offerings. Because of this we're unlikely to use them long-term and will pass on testing the tablets in lieu of another supplier
 
## Economics and breakeven
 
Running the Foodcycler is roughly $0.60 at Chicago's average kWh price of ~$0.13 - nealy $220/year to run daily. We spend around $300/year on plant nutrients and soil at a roughly 50/50 split. We'd need to displace our entire annual use of Bat Guano and Fox Farms Big Bloom to break-even (and then some).
 
### Bump the ratio
 
If we could move from the suggested 3/10 amendment ratio toward 1/2 or higher, then we could likely replace meaningful soil input $ as well - this will be the next test. As the season rolls in we will also look to pre-digest our compost and see if some combination thereof can accomplish the same goal.
 
### Compost Tea
 
A fallback "no this is worth the money" use could be compost teas...something we will be doing more of when we switch our indoor grow to no-till. An FAQ on their website mentions that the Company "hasn't tried but it's on their list" (paraphrasing).
 
## First Run
 
~5hours, very little noise compared to even a modern dishwasher.

## Result
We did not read the instructions carefully RE "stringy" vegetables - still seemed to process fine. Use of the resulting DFW is explored <a href="https://clarkadisney.github.io/plants/2021/02/02/mycotest1.html">here<a/>
