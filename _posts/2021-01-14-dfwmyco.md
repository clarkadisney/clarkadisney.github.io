# Foodcycler
 
A "Foodcycler" is a product that calls itself an "electric composter." It dehydrates and pulverizes food quickly, leaving behind dehydrated food waste (DFW). To use this DFW, Foodcycler recommends a 1-month cure, additional microbial treatment, and a soil application ratio of 3/10. I'll dive into these guidelines, and will investigate whether they can be tweaked to make it an attractive option for home use.

## Competitors 

There are several established and start up products and companies; these will be explored later

## Scalability of decentralized composting

This analysis explores how effective this product can be at the individual level and inherently discounts benefits at scale. I posit that individual adoption at any level is a good angle of attack to couple with - or create demand for - incentivized approaches (grants etc). The latter is something that has been done and in some cases where it hasn't there can be found a <i>potential</i> <a href="https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/organics/food/commercial/dehydrators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regulatory</a> framework.

There are numerous<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334059397_Decentralized_Community_Composting_Feasibility_Analysis_for_Residential_Food_Waste_A_Chicago_Case_Study" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> studies</a> related to the potential of scaling this technology including a <a href="https://nelson.civicweb.net/document/90881/FoodCycler%20Budget%202021%20presentation.pdf?handle=3C9551DFFAA740619CE29D05234C64A8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">municipal</a> deployment of this specific product and the <b>carbon economics</b> vs traditional recycling (below) that I'll dive into in a follow-on note.

## Goal
 
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether the Foodcycler can serve as a tool to process our food waste back into an input that meaningfully replaces one or multiple inputs that we regularly purchase. 
 
## Microbial Tablets

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/assets/images/microbiome/foodcyclertabs.JPG"><img class="projectimage" src="/assets/images/microbiome/foodcyclertabs.JPG"></a>

Vitamix sells "foodilizer" tablets to be dissolved and sprayed on the finished product to aid in soil decomposition. They mention Trichoderma, Bacillus, and some other ingredients similar to those who have encountered Mycorrhizal Fungi and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza_helper_bacteria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helper bacteria</a>. There is unfortunately, nothing further available as to which strains are included...something we'll likely want control over.
 
### Overpriced vs market

| item      	| $ total 	| oz weight 	| $ / oz 	|
|-------------	|---------	|-----------	|--------	|
| Foodilizer  	| 20      	| 0.3       	| 67     	|
| Great White 	| 20      	| 4         	| 5      	|


They're not cheap at roughly 0.3oz for $20 vs ~$5/oz for proven suppliers with targeted offerings. Because of this we're unlikely to use them long-term and will pass on testing the tablets in lieu of another supplier
 
## Economics and breakeven


| item      	| type    	| $   	|  $ total  |      
|-----------	|---------	|-----	|---------  |
| unit      	| initial 	| 299 	| 299       |
| filter    	| tri   	| 25 	| 75        |
| electric  	| annual  	| 20 	| 20        |
| microbial 	| annual  	| *   	| *         |


The Device cost ~$300, which I won't count because I posit that widespread, scaled adoption would come with subsidies (as explored <a href="http://thenelsondaily.com/news/new-direction-considered-residential-organics-collection-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here)</a>. I'll cover that in depth in a later note, but keep in mind that a municipal garbage/recycling bins alone can cost roughly the same as a unit - and are often filled with <a href="https://www.npr.org/local/309/2020/08/11/901299345/your-questions-about-recycling-and-composting-in-chicago-answered#:~:text=%22And%20when%20you%20see%20that,hauling%20of%20that%20food%20waste." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">food waste</a>.

Electricity is ~$0.06/day at Chicago's average kWh price of ~$0.13 (~$21/yr)

I do not know the qty of microbial amendments we'll need yet, but I am positive we'll need them. Our combined spend for that and non-seed/water inputs: 

| category 	| item                              	| type   	    | $ 	| $ total 	|
|----------	|--------------------------------------	|-------------	|------	|-------	|
| nute    	| big bloom 32oz                       	| quarterly 	|   20 	|    80 	|
| amend    	| great white                         	| triannually 	|   20 	|    60 	|
| soil    	| purple cow/FFOF                   	| quarterly   	|   30 	|   120 	|

We spend ~$260/year on nutrients, microbial amendments, and soil. We need only to  <i>eliminate</i> the "big bloom" nutrient entirely and slightly reduce soil use by adding in DFW at the suggested 3/10 ratio to break even. Selectivity RE food recycled will be our friend in dialing in a nutrient replacement for specific crops. Big Bloom is potassium heavy, but that's not really necessary for general vegetable growth. 


### Bump the ratio
 
If we could move from the suggested 3/10 amendment ratio toward 1/2 or higher, then we could likely replace meaningful soil input $ as well - I will test increasingly large amounts until we hit the death/damage range to see what the "average cap" can be. 

### Pre-compost
As the season rolls in I will also look to add this "pre-digested" food to our compost tumbler to see whether it can accelerate the composting process.

### Compost Tea
 
A fallback option could be compost teas...something we will be doing more of when we switch our indoor grow to no-till. This entails putting the DFW into cheesecloth and boiling it like a tea bag, then using the solution as a liquid fertilizer.

## First Run

 <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/assets/images/microbiome/foodcycler1.JPG"><img class="projectimage" src="/assets/images/microbiome/foodcycler1.JPG"></a>
 
~5hours, very little noise compared to a modern dishwasher.

## Result

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/assets/images/microbiome/foodcycler4.JPG"><img class="projectimage" src="/assets/images/microbiome/foodcycler4.JPG"></a>
 
We did not read the instructions carefully RE "stringy" vegetables - still seemed to process fine. Experiments with the resulting DFW is can be found <a href="https://clarkadisney.github.io/microbiome">here<a/>
