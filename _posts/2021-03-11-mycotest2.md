# Experiment

### Description

This test is to determine whether there are easily-identifiable gains in the early growth stages of French Breakfast Radishes grown in cylindrical 36-cell plug trays with the addition of Mycorrhizae and Bacteria. This test was inspired by the plug tray tests of <a href="https://www.greenhousegrower.com/production/plug-tray-density-and-hydroponic-radish-production/">Peter Konjoian,</a> however we will be using only <b><a href="https://www.greenhousegrower.com/production/plug-tray-density-and-hydroponic-radish-production/">OMRI-listed</a></b> organic inputs and rather than flood/dirain hydro, will be bottom watering using the swick/SIP wick system dexcribed <b>here</b>.   

### Methods

Radishes are planted in nutrient-dense <b>non-living</b> Fox Farms Ocean Forest. 12 radish seeds have been be dusted in Mykos brand (endo + ecto) prior to planting, another 12 were coated in Great White brand (endo + ecto + bacteria), with the final 12 planted normally.

## Results

### 4 days

Roughly 1/3 have sprouted with no discernible pattern.
