## Original Mission and Wireframe

<i>Local Option is a privacy-focused photograph management system currently in development. We believe that your memories are yours, and that your family shouldn't need to give marketers intimate access to your personal lives in exchange for storage and sorting features.</i>

<i>No demo yet, but we expect to have something to kick the tires on in 2019. The program is currently written in JavaScript, utilizes openCV.js, and is packaged in Electron.</i>

<i>Below are some teaser screenshots, please check for updates:</i>
