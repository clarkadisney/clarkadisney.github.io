# Did it work?
Swimmingly. We had a jungle up here significantly faster than any prior season. The size of the crops were in some cases noticeably larger, and the formerly typical soil top-offs were reduced and - in some areas unnecessary. We had a rolling harvest that started in June/July and lasting into November.

We'd expected to need to add <i>something</i>, whether that be some immediately-available liquid organic nutrient - or even some mycorrhizal fungi to help with the compost breakdown. Not once was this required...not even after topping with excessive, not-finished compost and coco coir. We likely would have stuck with this method regardless due to our goal of closed-loop, but the added growth was a major bonus.
