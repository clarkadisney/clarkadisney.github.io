# Growrack v3
Moving to grow bags.
 
## Power Stats:
- Cheap 30x18x36 mylar/canvas tent on bottom 
- 135w QB288 @3500k
- Passive intake baffle made from PC cases
- Active exhaust via PC fans totaling 800mHa wired to 12v wall-wart
- Oscillating 6" 2600mHa fan to disperse
- 2x 30w 4000k LED shop lights
 
## Switched to grow bags for propagation
 
Switched to bottom watering + disposable woven grow bags for seed starting and cloning under dome to help with early root development

## Transplanted remainder from 3601 to bags
 
Left Root veggies (brussel sprout and beets) in plastic, cut to fit. Transplanted all greens with no major issues. Used 1/4 & 1/2 bags in "square" "round" and "short."

## Initial Results
 
Initial "Grow Bag" results were great, some concern on fungus gnat and too much humidity. Will consider fans and / or wicking setup.

## SWICK attempt
 
Moved brussel sprouts to perlite-filled container for "SWICK" attempt at passive Hydro.  Stopped when algae developed (pictured). Will resume with strip-wicking attempt.
